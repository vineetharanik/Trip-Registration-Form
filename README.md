# Trip-Registration-Form
Just built my first full-stack mini project — a Trip Registration Form that connects HTML + CSS + PHP + MySQL 
The form collects participant details and stores them in a MySQL database. After submission, it auto-redirects to a page that can display all entries.
Learnt about form handling, POST requests, database insertion, and redirect logic in PHP. Also realized why SQL basics are so important — will be diving deeper into it next!
